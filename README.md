The variable in my game works by the player gaining and losing money. When they buy something, they lose money. They also lose money if they trip. They gain money if they pick up the money on the ground. The if and else macro in my game works by, if the player has a certain amount of money when they trip, they will be told a certain message. If they have 0 dollars, they will be told that they have no money. If they have more than 0, they will be told how much money they have. I chose to use an if macro here instead of making a new passage, because I didn't want the player to have to click on something. I wanted the player to just click the link, which leads to the passage where they fall. I didn't want them to have to click another link. I don't think that it would have looked very good in the game.
